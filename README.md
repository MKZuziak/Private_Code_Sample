# Code_Sample
This repository includes projects implemented during different coursework, puzzles and challenges. The code is demonstrative in nature, and it does not contain the complete set of solutions that are implemented in each selected course - but only those that were selected by me for various reasons. Sometimes it is the fact that the code could spoil the fun of solving a particular challenge (and the repo is public in nature), sometimes, the code is already placed in a different place, and I haven't felt the need to put it here - feel free to glance over the code examples, but please remember that the examples are neither optimised nor specially polished to be displayed. Treat this repository more like contain-it-all bag that I use from time to time.
